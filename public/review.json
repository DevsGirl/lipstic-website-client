      "description": "I recently came across a few lipsticks from a company called Kismet Cosmetics. Many of you probably have not heard of this brand. I hadn't either until very recently. Kismet is a boutique cosmetics brand that is based out of Louisiana and was created by a local makeup artist in the area.",

      "description": "These lipsticks are vibrant, long lasting and extremely hydrating. I tried 3 of the 10 semi-matte colors that are currently part of the Velvet Collection and if the other 7 lipsticks hold up to the same standards I would highly recommend giving them a try.",

      "description": "This lipstick surprised me. Looking at the color in the tube I thought it would be my least favorite of the semi-mattes. Turns out, it ended up being my favorite! In the tube it looked like it would be dryer than the other lipsticks and that it would transfer as a flat purple on my lips.",
